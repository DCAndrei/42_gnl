# 42_gnl
The Get_Next_Line project from 42 Wolfsburg school

You should read a line from a file descriptor and return the line, the line separator is the '\n' (new line character).
For the bonus part you should be able to read from any fd, without loosing the read position, as long as the fd is open.

The mandatory and bonus parts are the same.

The project passed Moulinette with 125/125
